# Hackathon-FIAM-2024—Revival 🚀

**Status:** Archival & Protection Initiative  
**Focus:** Preserve and safeguard the work produced during Hackathon 2024.  

---

## 🔥 Purpose

This repository exists first and foremost as an **archive** of our team’s work.  
- To ensure that our code, research, and insights are **preserved intact**.  
- To guarantee that no one can remove, alter, or block access to this work — especially not right before it is needed.  
- To establish a **clear, public, and enforceable legal framework** around our contributions.

## ⚖️ Intellectual Property & Licensing

Out of caution, and given the lack of confidence in ad-hoc “property rights” during competitions.

- **Why Apache 2.0?**  
  Because it is **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable**.  
  Once code is shared under this license, it **cannot be taken back or removed** unless terms are breached.

- Reminder (Apache 2.0, Section 2):  
  > *“Each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, **irrevocable** copyright license…”*  

**Clear. No take-backs.**

## 🧭 Vision

This repo is not nostalgia.  
It is a **shield**: a structured, transparent archive of our collective work.  

The objective is simple:  
- Preserve.  
- Protect.  
- Ensure continuity.  

**No one can pull the plug one week before execution.**
